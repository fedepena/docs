Welcome! We're here to help

I just wanted to thank you personally for the interest in our software and let you know we are available to help.

To get a good idea on how to get started with myAbakus, we recommend watching the introduction videos on the Getting Started Course. https://www.myabakus.com/help/practical-accounting-course.html

And if you want personal assistance getting started, we can arrange a virtual meeting to go over the process with you. Just reply to this message to schedule it.

You can also start on your own and get in touch if you have questions. We're here to help you anytime.

And if you are interested in improving your general knowledge of accounting, we recommend subscribing to our email course: Practical Accounting for Non-Accountants. http://eepurl.com/cLZMT9
