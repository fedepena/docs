We can now use different prefixes and numbering in our invoices.

To configure them we go to "Your account" and on the right side under documents we click on "Invoice".

Here we can see the prefix we are using at the moment and to add a new one we clic on the plus sign

We enter the new prefix we want to use, for example, OI, and the number we want to start with, say, 0001.

Let's save and see what happens when we create a new invoice.

The first prefix is automatically selected, but now I have the option to change it to the one we just created with its corresponding next number.

We can also configure multiple prefixes for our quotes and credit notes from "Your account" following the same steps.

We hope this was helpful and clear and if you have questions, please contact us by chat from our website or inside the app.
