Hi

Thanks for writing.

To get a good idea on how to get started with myAbakus, we recommend watching the introduction videos on the [Getting Started Course](https://www.myabakus.com/help/practical-accounting-course.html)

And if you want personal assistance getting started, we can arrange a virtual meeting to go over the process with you. Just reply to this message to schedule it.

Cheers
