Title: How do I enter my outstanding balances and payment if I do not have invoices

To enter all those accounts that we have outstanding receivable and payable we must do it through a transaction.

We go to Revenue, we say new transaction, we can select or write the date we use, for example the end of last month.

In client, we place the name of the person or company that owes us. For example Coyote.

In the name of the item, we will create a general one that allows us to identify later that those invoices correspond to accounts previous to our beginning in myabakus.

For example "Earlier Accounts" and we classify it as "services".

We will save and automatically these transactions will be part of our accounts receivable report.

In the case of accounts payable with our suppliers, we do the same procedure only from the Expenses option and the accounts payable report.
