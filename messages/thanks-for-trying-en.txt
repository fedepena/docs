Hi

I just wanted to thank for trying our software and let you know that I'm the person in charge of helping you get started.

I'm a real person and this is not just an automated response, so I would like to call you to briefly introduce myself.

When I call or at a later time if not convenient, I would also like to ask you a few questions about your business to determine if myAbakus fits your needs and to answer any question you might have.

Is X your mobile number? If so, would it be ok if I contact you via WhatsApp?

Cheers
